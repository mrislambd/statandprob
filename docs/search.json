    "text": "Problem 1: Leetcode 69: Sqrt(x)\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a non-negative integer, \\(x\\), return the square root of \\(x\\) rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.\nYou may not use any built-in exponent function. For example, x**0.5 in python.\nExample:\nInput: x=4\nOutput: 2  \n\nInput: x=8\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Square root of 4 is 2 and square root of 8 is 2.8284. But we need to round down to any fraction. Therefore, the square root of 8 is also 2.\nSolution:\nThe square root of any number \\(x\\ge 0\\) is less than or equal to \\(x\\). The brute force solution to this would be \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\). Because, say \\(x=8\\), then\nfor \\(i=1\\) to 8: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  1^2 & = 1 &lt;8 \\\\\n  2^2 & = 4 &lt;8\\\\\n  3^2 & = 9 &gt;8\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nIn contrast, if we explore binary search then the time complexity reduces to \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log{n})\\). Say the square root is \\(s\\) which is the middle value in the range of 1 to \\(x\\). Then if \\(s^2&gt;x\\), we search for the root in the left half. Otherwise, if \\(s^2&lt;x\\) then we search the right side. However, when \\(s^2&lt;x\\), then \\(s\\) is a possible candidate for the square root.\nAlgorithm:\n\nset left value \\(l= 0\\), right value \\(r= x\\)\n\nCompute the middle value \\(m=l+(r-l)/2\\)\n\nIf \\(m^2 &gt; x\\) then search the left side: set \\(r=m-1\\)\n\nIf \\(m^2 &lt; x\\) then search the right side: set \\(l=m+1\\)\n\n\ndef square_root(x):\n  l, r = 0, x \n  sq = 0\n  while l&lt;=r:\n    m = l + (r-l)//2 \n    if m**2 &gt; x:\n      r= m-1\n    elif m**2 &lt; x:\n      l = m+1 \n      sq = m\n    else:\n      return m  \n  return sq \n      \nprint(square_root(6))\n\n2"

However, what happens in this case is that the joint distribution degenerates into a one-dimensional structure (a line) rather than being a two-dimensional probability density.\n\nTo see why, consider the quadratic term inside the exponential:\n\\[\nQ = \\frac{(x-\\mu_X)^2}{\\sigma_X^2} - 2\\rho \\frac{(x-\\mu_X)(y-\\mu_Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} + \\frac{(y-\\mu_Y)^2}{\\sigma_Y^2}\n\\]\nWhen \\(|\\rho| = 1\\), this quadratic expression simplifies, as shown next.\nStart with the simplified \\(Q\\) when \\(|\\rho| = 1\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nQ &= \\left( \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\right)^2 - 2\\rho \\left( \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\cdot \\frac{y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2\\\\\n&=\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} - \\rho \\frac{y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is a perfect square because the “cross term” cancels out all independent variability of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) when \\(|\\rho| = 1\\).\nFor the quadratic term \\(Q\\) to have any non-zero probability density (since it appears in the exponent of the PDF), it must be equal to zero: \\[\n\\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} - \\rho \\frac{y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} = 0\n\\]\nRearranging this equation: \\[\n\\frac{y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} = \\rho \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\n\\]\nMultiply through by \\(\\sigma_Y\\): \\[\ny - \\mu_Y = \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_X} (x - \\mu_X)\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(Y| X=x)&= \\mu_Y + \\rho\\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_X}(x-\\mu_X)\\\\\n& = \\mu_Y + \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_X} (x - \\mu_X)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the equation of a straight line in the \\((X, Y)\\)-plane.

Fitting the model involves finding \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and the estimating the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\alpha}+\\hat{\\beta}x\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}= \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{y}-\\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x}\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the observed value of a statistic \\(\\hat{B}\\) whose sampling distribution has the following properties\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{B}]=\\beta, \\hspace{4mm} var[\\hat{B}]=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}}\n\\]\nAnd the estimate of the error variance\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 & =\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum (y_i -\\hat{y_i})^2\\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{n-2} \\left(S_{yy}-\\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nGoodness of fit\nTo better understand the goodness of fit of the model for the data at hand, we can study the total variation in the responses, as given by\n\\[\nS_{yy} = \\sum (y_i-\\bar{y})^2\n\\]\nLet’s see how:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_i - \\bar{y} &= (y_i - \\hat{y_i}) + (\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y}) \\\\\n\\implies (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 & = \\left((y_i - \\hat{y_i}) + (\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})\\right)^2\\\\\n& = (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2(y_i - \\hat{y_i})(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})+(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& = (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 [y_i -(\\hat{\\alpha}+\\hat{\\beta}x_i)][\\hat{\\alpha}+\\hat{\\beta}x_i-(\\hat{\\alpha}+\\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x})]+(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& = (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\hat{\\beta}\\left(y_i -\\hat{\\alpha}-\\hat{\\beta}x_i\\right)(x_i-\\bar{x})+(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n\\implies \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 & =\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\hat{\\beta}\\sum\\left(y_i -\\hat{\\alpha}-\\hat{\\beta}x_i\\right)(x_i-\\bar{x})+\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& =\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\hat{\\beta}\\left[\\sum x_iy_i-\\bar{x}\\sum y_i -\\hat{\\alpha}\\sum x_i + n\\hat{\\alpha}\\bar{x}-\\hat{\\beta}\\sum x_i^2\\right.\\\\\n&\\left.\\hspace{4mm}+\\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x}\\sum x_i\\right]+\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& =\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\hat{\\beta}\\left(\\sum x_iy_i-n\\bar{x}\\bar{y}\\right)-2\\hat{\\beta}^2\\left(\\sum x_i^2 - n\\bar{x}^2\\right)+\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\hat{\\beta}S_{xy}-2\\hat{\\beta}^2S_{xx}+\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n& = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 + 2 \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}S_{xy}-2\\left(\\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\\right)^2S_{xx}+\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\n\\implies \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 & =\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 +\\sum(\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})^2\\\\\nSS_{TOT} & = SS_{RES}+ SS_{REG}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn the case that the data are “close” to a line ( \\(|r|\\) high- a strong linear relationship) the model fits well, the fitted responses (the values on the fitted line) are close to the observed responses, and so \\(SS_{REG}\\) is relatively high with \\(SS_{RES}\\) relatively low.\nIn the case that the data are not “close” to a line ( \\(|r|\\) low - a weak linear relationship) the model does not fit so well, the fitted responses are not so close to the observed responses, and so \\(SS_{REG}\\) is relatively low and \\(SS_{RES}\\) relatively high.\nThe proportion of the total variability of the responses “explained” by a model is called the coefficient of determination, denoted \\(R^2\\) .\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{REG}}{SS_{TOT}} =\\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}S_{yy}}\n\\]\nwhich takes value between 0 to 1, inclusive. The higher \\(R^2\\), the better fitting.\nFor our data, we have:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nn & = 10, \\hspace{4mm} \\sum x = 35.66, \\hspace{4mm} \\sum y = 32.47\\\\\nS_{xx} &= 8.53 \\hspace{4mm} S_{yy}=6.97, \\hspace{4mm} S_{xy}=7.13\\\\\n\\implies \\hat{\\beta} &=\\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}= \\frac{7.13}{8.53} = 0.836\\\\\n\\hat{\\alpha} &= \\frac{\\sum y}{n} - \\hat{\\beta} \\frac{\\sum x}{n} = \\bar{y}-\\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x}\\\\\n& = 3.247 - 0.836 \\times 3.566 = 0.266\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore, the fitted line would be \\(\\hat{y}=0.266 + 0.836x\\). Now we see the other metrics\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nSS_{TOT} &= 6.97 \\\\\nSS_{REG} & = \\frac{S_{yy}^2}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{6.97^2}{8.53}=5.695\\\\\nSS_{RES} & = 6.97 - 5.695 = 1.275 \\\\\n\\implies \\hat{\\sigma}^2 & = \\frac{1.275}{8}=0.1594\\\\\nR^2 & = \\frac{5.695}{6.97}=0.817\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters for the line\nalpha = 0.266  \nbeta = 0.836   \n\n# Line values\nline_x = np.linspace(min(df.StockPrice), max(df.StockPrice), 100)  \nline_y = alpha + beta * line_x             \n\n# Plot\nplt.scatter(df.StockPrice, df.Portfolio, color='blue', label='Data Points')\nplt.plot(line_x, line_y, color='red', label=f'Line: y = {alpha} + {beta}x')\n\n# Labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Stock Price')\nplt.ylabel('Portfolio')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot with Regression Line')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInference on \\(\\beta\\)\nWe can rewrite \\(\\hat{\\beta}= \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\\), as\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\beta}&= \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})y_i-\\bar{y}\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x}y_i)-\\bar{y}\\left(\\sum x_i -n\\bar{x}\\right)}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})y_i}{S_{xx}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow we recall that \\(\\hat{B}\\) is the random variable that has \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) as its realization. Therefore, \\(\\hat{B}=\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})Y_i}{S_{xx}}\\). We also recall that \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y_i)=\\alpha +\\beta x\\). Putting these together we obtain,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{B}] &= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})Y_i}{S_{xx}}\\right] = \\frac{\\sum (x_i -\\bar{x})\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})(\\alpha + \\beta x_i)}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\alpha \\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})+\\beta \\sum x_i (x_i-\\bar{x})}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\alpha \\left(\\sum x_i -n\\bar{x}\\right)+\\beta \\left(\\sum x_i^2-\\bar{x}\\sum x_i\\right)}{S_{xx}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\alpha (n\\bar{x}-n\\bar{x})+\\beta\\left(\\sum x_i^2-n\\bar{x}^2\\right)}{S_{xx}}\\\\\n& = \\frac{0+\\beta S_{xx}}{S_{xx}} = \\beta\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow the fact that \\(Y_i'\\)s are uncorrelated. Therefore, \\(var\\left(\\sum (Y_i)\\right)=\\sum var(Y_i)\\) and we have \\(var(Y_i)=\\sigma^2\\). Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nvar[\\hat{B}]& = var\\left[\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})Y_i}{S_{xx}}\\right]= \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2var[Y_i]}{S_{xx}^2}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}^2}\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}^2}S_{xx}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\beta})=\\beta\\) and \\(var(\\hat{\\beta})=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}}\\) so\n\\[\nM = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}-\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{S_{xx}}}}\\sim N(0,1)\n\\]\nand the observed variance \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) has the property\n\\[\nN = \\frac{(n-2)\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi_{n-2}^2\n\\]\nSince \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) are independent, it follows that\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{\\sqrt{\\frac{N}{n-2}}} \\sim t_{n-2}\n\\]\nIn other words: \\[\n\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}-\\beta}{se(\\hat{\\beta})} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}-\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{S_{xx}}}} \\sim t_{n-2}\n\\]\nNow the big question is what’s the use of this mathematical jargon that we have learned so far? Let’s use our regression problem on stock data to explain.\n\\(H_0: \\beta =0\\), there is no linear relationship\nvs\n\\(H_1: \\beta&gt; 0\\), there is a linear relationship\nBased on our data we have \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.836\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=0.1594\\), and \\(S_{xx}=8.53\\). Therefore, under \\(H_0\\), the test statistic\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}-0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{S_{xx}}}} \\text{ has a } t_{10-2} \\text{ or } t_8 \\text{ distribution}\n\\]\nBut the observed value of this statistic \\[\n\\frac{0.836-0}{\\sqrt{0.1594/8.53}}=6.1156\n\\]\nwhich is way higher than the critical value at \\(5\\%\\) significance level.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.stats import t\n\n# Parameters\ndf = 8  # Degrees of freedom\nalpha = 0.05  # Upper tail probability\nt_critical = t.ppf(1 - alpha, df)  # Critical t-value at the 95th percentile\n\n# Generate x values for the t-distribution\nx = np.linspace(-4, 4, 500)\ny = t.pdf(x, df)\n\n# Plot the t-distribution\nplt.plot(x, y, label=f't_{df} Distribution', color='blue')\nplt.fill_between(x, y, where=(x &gt;= t_critical), color='red', alpha=0.5, label=f'Upper {alpha*100}% Area')\n\n# Annotate the critical t-value on the x-axis\nplt.axvline(t_critical, ymin=0.02, ymax=0.30,color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Critical t-value = {t_critical:.2f}')\nplt.text(t_critical, -0.02, f'{t_critical:.2f}', color='red', ha='center', va='top')\n\n# Add a horizontal line at y = 0\nplt.axhline(0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=0.8)\n\n# Labels, title, and legend\nplt.title(f\"t-Distribution with {df} Degrees of Freedom\")\nplt.xlabel(\"t\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Density\")\nplt.legend()\n\n# Adjust plot limits\n\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) at the \\(5\\%\\) level and conclude that there is a very strong evidence that \\(\\beta&gt;0\\), i.e., the portfolio value is increasing over stock price.\nAlternatively, let’s put our analysis in a different approach. We claim that\n\\(H_0: \\beta=1\\), there is a linear relationship\nvs\n\\(H_1: \\beta \\ne 1\\)\nIn this case,\n\\[\nse(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{S_{xx}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1594}{8.53}} =0.1367\n\\]\nTherefore, the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\beta\\) is\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta} \\pm \\left\\{t_{0.025,8}\\times se(\\hat{\\beta})\\right\\}=0.836 \\pm 2.306\\times 0.1367 = (0.5207,1.1512)\n\\]\nThe \\(95\\%\\) two-sided confidence interval contains the value \\(1\\), so the two-sided test conducted at \\(5\\%\\) level results in \\(H_0\\) being accepted.\n\n\nMean Response and Individual Response\n\nMean Response\n\nIf \\(\\mu_0\\) is the expected (mean) response for a value \\(x_0\\) of the predictor variable, that is \\(\\mu_0 = \\mathbb{E}[Y|x_0]=\\alpha +\\beta x_0\\), then \\(\\mu_0\\) is an unbiased estimator given by\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_0 = \\hat{\\alpha}+\\hat{\\beta} x_0\n\\]\nand the variance of the estimator is given by\n\\[\nvar(\\hat{\\mu}_0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_0-\\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)\\sigma^2\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_0-\\mu_0}{se[\\hat{\\mu}_0] }= \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_0-\\mu_0}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_0-\\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)\\sigma^2}}\\sim t_{n-2}\n\\]\n\n\nIndividual Response\nThe actual estimate of an individual response \\[\n\\hat{y}_0 = \\hat{\\alpha} +\\hat{\\beta}x_0\n\\]\n\nHowever, the uncertainty associated with this estimator, as indicated by its variance, is higher compared to the mean estimator because it relies on the value of an individual response \\(y_0\\) rather than the more stable mean. To account for the additional variability of an individual response relative to the mean, an extra term, \\(\\sigma^2\\), must be included in the variance expression for the estimator of a mean response.\n\n\\[\nvar[\\hat{y}_0] = \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_0-\\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)\\sigma^2\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{y}-y_0}{se[\\hat{y}_0]}=\\frac{\\hat{y}-y_0}{\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_0-\\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)\\sigma^2}}\\sim t_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nLet’s put this two idea through our example. If we want to find a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval or the expected portfolio value on stock price of say, 360. In that case,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Estimate of the expected portfolio value} = 0.266+0.836\\times 3.6 = 3.276\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\text{se}[\\text{Estimate}] = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{(3.6-3.566)^2}{8.53}\\right) 0.1594}=0.1263\n\\]\nSo, the \\(95\\%\\) CI\n\\[\n3.276\\pm (t_{0.025,8}\\times \\text{se}[\\text{Estimate}]) = 3.276 \\pm 2.306\\times 0.1263 = (2.985,3.567)\n\\]\nThat is for a stock price of \\(\\$360\\), the expected portfolio value would be in the range of \\((\\$298.50,\\$356.70)\\)\nSimilarly, the \\(95\\%\\) CI for the predicted actual portfolio value\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n3.276\\pm (t_{0.025,8}\\times \\text{se}[\\text{Estimate}]) &= 3.276 \\pm 2.306\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{(3.6-3.566)^2}{8.53}\\right) 0.1594}\\\\\n& = (2.3103,4.2417)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nor \\((\\$231.03,\\$424.17)\\)\n\n\n\nModel Accuracy\nThe residual from the fit at \\(x_i\\) is the estimated error which is defined by \\[\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\n\\]\n\nScatter plots of residuals versus the explanatory variable (or the fitted response values) are particularly insightful. A lack of random scatter in the residuals, such as the presence of a discernible pattern, indicates potential shortcomings in the model.\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Stock': ['Apple', 'Citi', 'MS', 'WF', 'GS', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Tesla', 'Toyota', 'SPY'],\n    'StockPrice': [2.11, 2.42, 2.52, 3.21, 3.62, 3.86, 4.13, 4.27, 4.51, 5.01], \n    'Portfolio': [2.12, 2.16, 2.51, 2.65, 3.62, 3.15, 4.32, 3.31, 4.18, 4.45]\n})\nx = df.StockPrice.values\ny = df.Portfolio.values \n\ny_hat = [0.266+0.836*i for i in x]\nplt.scatter(x, y-y_hat)\nplt.axhline(0)\nplt.ylabel('Residuals')\nplt.xlabel('Stock Price')\nplt.title('Scatter plot of the residuals from the fitted line')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, we can see that the residuals tend to increase as \\(x\\) increases, indicates that the error variance is not bounded, but increasing with \\(x\\). So, the model is not the best one. A transformation of the responses may stabilize the error variance.   In certain case, for some growth models, the appropriate model is that the expected response is related to the exploratory variable through an exponential relationship, i.e.,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i|X=x_i] &= \\alpha e^{\\beta x_i}\\\\\n\\implies z_i = \\log y_i & = \\eta + \\beta x_i + \\epsilon_i; \\hspace{4mm}\\text{where }\\eta=\\log \\alpha\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nCode\nx = df.StockPrice.values\ny = np.log(df.Portfolio.values)\n\nn = len(x)\n\nx_sum, y_sum =0,0\ns_xx, s_yy, s_xy = 0,0,0\nfor i in range(n):\n    x_sum += x[i]\n    s_xx += x[i]**2\n    y_sum += y[i]\n    s_yy += y[i]**2\n    s_xy += x[i]*y[i]    \n\ns_xx = s_xx - (x_sum)**2/n\ns_yy = s_yy - (y_sum)**2/n\ns_xy = s_xy - (x_sum * y_sum)/n\n\nr = s_xy/math.sqrt(s_xx * s_yy)\n\n# Print with formatted labels\nprint(f\"Sum x: {x_sum:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Sum y: {y_sum:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Sₓₓ: {s_xx:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Sᵧᵧ: {s_yy:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Sₓᵧ: {s_xy:.2f}\")\nprint(' ')\nprint(f\"r : {r:.2f}\")\n\n\nSum x: 35.66\nSum y: 11.43\nSₓₓ: 8.53\nSᵧᵧ: 0.70\nSₓᵧ: 2.29\n \nr : 0.94\n\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nn & = 10, \\hspace{4mm} \\sum x = 35.66, \\hspace{4mm} \\sum y = 11.43\\\\\nS_{xx} &= 8.53 \\hspace{4mm} S_{yy}=0.70, \\hspace{4mm} S_{xy}=2.29\\\\\n\\implies \\hat{\\beta} &=\\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}= \\frac{2.29}{8.53} = 0.268\\\\\n\\hat{\\alpha} &= \\frac{\\sum y}{n} - \\hat{\\beta} \\frac{\\sum x}{n} = \\bar{y}-\\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x}\\\\\n& = 1.143 - 0.268 \\times 3.566 = 0.1873\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nz_hat = [np.log(0.1873)+0.268*i for i in x]\nz = np.log(y)\nplt.scatter(x, z-z_hat)\nplt.axhline(np.mean(z-z_hat))\nplt.ylabel('Residuals')\nplt.xlabel('Stock Price')\nplt.title('Scatter plot of the residuals from the fitted line')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the residuals look good, that is no special pattern or increasing the error variance.\nThanks for reading."

    "text": "Why Bayesian Inference in Machine Learning?\nBayesian inference plays a crucial role in machine learning, particularly in areas involving uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning. It allows us to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs based on new data, which is especially useful in the following applications:\n\nBayesian Networks\nBayesian networks are graphical models that represent the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. Each node in the network represents a random variable, and the edges represent conditional dependencies. Bayesian networks are used for various tasks such as classification, prediction, and anomaly detection.\n\n\nBayesian Regression\nBayesian regression extends linear regression by incorporating prior distributions on the model parameters. This approach provides a probabilistic framework for regression analysis, allowing for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The posterior distribution of the parameters is computed using Bayes’s theorem, and predictions are made by averaging over this distribution.\n\n\nSampling Methods\nIn Bayesian inference, exact computation of the posterior distribution is often intractable. Therefore, sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference are used to approximate the posterior distribution. These methods generate samples from the posterior distribution, allowing us to estimate various statistical properties and make inferences.\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nMCMC methods generate a sequence of samples from the posterior distribution by constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. Common MCMC algorithms include the Underdamped and Overdamped Langevin dynamics, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler.\nExample: Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm\nConsider a posterior distribution \\(P(\\theta|D)\\) where \\(\\theta\\) represents the model parameters and \\(D\\) represents the data. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nInitialize the parameters \\(\\theta_0\\).\nFor \\(t = 1\\) to \\(T\\):\n\nPropose a new state \\(\\theta'\\) from a proposal distribution \\(Q(\\theta'|\\theta_t)\\).\nCompute the acceptance ratio \\(\\alpha = \\frac{P(\\theta'|D) \\cdot Q(\\theta_t|\\theta')}{P(\\theta_t|D) \\cdot Q(\\theta'|\\theta_t)}\\).\nAccept the new state with probability \\(\\min(1, \\alpha)\\). If accepted, set \\(\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta'\\); otherwise, set \\(\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t\\).\n\n\nThe samples \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_T\\) form a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution \\(P(\\theta|D)\\).\n\n\nBayesian Inference in Neural Networks\nBayesian methods are also applied to neural networks, resulting in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs incorporate uncertainty in the network weights by placing a prior distribution over them and using Bayes’s theorem to update this distribution based on the observed data. This allows BNNs to provide not only point estimates but also uncertainty estimates for their predictions.\nIn the next parts, we will talk about different applications of the Bayesian inferences, specifically, sampling problem using Langevin dynamics.\n\n\nReference\n\nPancake problems on mathstackexchance\n\nShare on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like"

    "text": "Basic Statistical Terminologies\n\nThe mean\nThe mean is one of the most basic statistical concepts and represents the average value of a dataset. It’s calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of observations.\nMathematically, for a set of discrete observations \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\), the mean \\(\\mu\\) or Expected Value is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu &=  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\\\\n\\implies \\mathbb{E}[X] &= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\mathbb{P}(X=x_i)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the mean\n\\[\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X]=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}xf_X(x)dx\n\\]\n\nwhere, \\(\\mathbb{P}(X=x)\\) is the probability mass function (pmf) and \\(f_X(x)\\) is the probability density function (pdf) of the random variable \\(X\\), depending on whether it is discrete or contineous type. The mean helps describe the central tendency of data, but it can be sensitive to outliers.\n\n\n\nVariance\n\nVariance measures the spread or dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. It tells us how far the individual data points are from the mean. A small variance indicates that data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a large variance means they are spread out.\n\nThe formula for variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\sigma^2=Var(X)&=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2\\\\\n    &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X-\\mathbb{E}[X])^2\\right]\\\\\n    &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X^2-2X\\mathbb{E}[X]+(\\mathbb{E}[X])^2)\\right]\\\\\n    &=\\mathbb{E}[X^2]-2\\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[X]+(\\mathbb{E}[X])^2\\\\\n    &=\\mathbb{E}[X^2]-(\\mathbb{E}[X])^2\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHowever, the population and sample variance formula are slightly different. For discrete observations, the sample variance is given as\n\\[ s= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2\\]\nInstead of dividing by \\(n\\) we devide by \\(n-1\\) to have the sample variance unbiased and bigger than the population variance so that it contains the true population variance.\nExamples\n\nNormal Distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) has the pdf \\(f_{X}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}\\exp{\\left[-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]}\\)\n\nStandard Normal Distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(1\\) has the pdf \\(f_{X}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}\\exp{\\left[-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]}\\)\n\nNow if \\(\\log X\\sim \\mathbfcal{N}(0,1)\\) then what is the distribution of \\(X\\)?\n\n\n\nCovariance\n\nCovariance measures how two variables move together. If the covariance is positive, the two variables tend to increase or decrease together. If negative, one variable tends to increase when the other decreases.\n\nThe formula for covariance between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\mu_X)(Y_i - \\mu_Y)\n\\]\nHowever, covariance doesn’t indicate the strength of the relationship, which brings us to correlation.\n\n\nCorrelation\n\nCorrelation is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\), where \\(1\\) indicates a perfect positive relationship, \\(-1\\) a perfect negative relationship, and \\(0\\) no relationship.\n\nThe most common correlation metric is Pearson correlation, defined as:\n\\[\n\\rho(X, Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nUnlike covariance, correlation gives a clearer picture of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between variables.\n\n\nP-Values and Hypothesis Testing\n\nP-values and hypothesis testing form the backbone of inferential statistics. Hypothesis testing is used to determine if a given assumption (the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)) about a population parameter is true or not.\n\n\nThe null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) typically suggests no effect or no difference.\nThe alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) is the claim you want to test.\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a result as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (usually less than 0.05) indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely, and we may reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. The idea behind MLE is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which represents the probability of observing the given data under a particular model.\n\nGiven a parameter \\(\\theta\\) and observed data \\(X\\), the likelihood function is:\n\\[\nL(\\theta | X) = P(X | \\theta)\n\\]\nMLE finds the parameter \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) that maximizes this likelihood:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} L(\\theta | X)\n\\]\nMLE is widely used in statistical modeling, from simple linear regression to complex machine learning algorithms.\n\n\nMaximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nWhile MLE focuses on maximizing the likelihood, Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation incorporates prior information about the parameters. MAP is rooted in Bayesian statistics, where the goal is to find the parameter that maximizes the posterior distribution.\nThe posterior is given by Bayes’ Theorem:\n\\[\nP(\\theta | X) = \\frac{P(X | \\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(X)}\n\\]\nMAP finds the parameter \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{MAP}}\\) that maximizes the posterior probability:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{MAP}} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} P(\\theta | X)\n\\]\nUnlike MLE, MAP estimation incorporates the prior distribution \\(P(\\theta)\\), making it more robust when prior knowledge is available\n\nShare on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like"
